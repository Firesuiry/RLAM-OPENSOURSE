# note 一些备注
由于时间久远，当时写代码时比较潦草，当时为了加速还用了多线程，代码可读性较差并且结构比较复杂。
/matAgent 是实现的一些对比算法
/task 是任务具体训练和评估的一些代码
/rl是关于强化学习的代码

程序主入口为main.py
运行的任务定义在main.py中的main函数中的need_run_tasks
如有问题可以提issue，我会尽快回复

Due to the long history, writing the code was quite sloppy at that time, and multithreading was used to speed up, resulting in poor readability and complex structure of the code.

/matAgent is a comparison algorithm implemented

/task is some code for task specific training and evaluation

/rl is the code about Reinforcement learning



The main entry of the program is main.py

The running task is defined as' need_run_tasks 'in the main function in main.py

If you have any questions, you can raise an issue and I will reply as soon as possible

# how to run

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
